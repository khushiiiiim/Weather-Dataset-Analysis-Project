# Weather-Dataset-Analysis-Project

**INTERN PROJECT PHASE - 1: DOCUMENTATION**

**1. Data Preparation with Python:**

In this phase, the weather dataset underwent a comprehensive data preparation process using Python. The following steps were executed:

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Identified and addressed missing values in the dataset.
  - Employed Python libraries, such as Pandas, to handle null values through imputation or removal, ensuring data integrity.

- **Outlier Handling:**
  - Detected outliers in the dataset using statistical methods or visualization techniques.
  
**2. Advanced Analysis with Power BI:**

For the advanced analysis phase, Power BI was employed to gain deeper insights into the weather dataset. The following steps were taken:

- **Leveraging BI Tools:**
  - Utilized Power BI for in-depth data analysis, taking advantage of their interactive features and visualization capabilities.

- **Dashboard Creation:**
  - Developed interactive dashboards showcasing key trends and patterns within the weather dataset.
  - Employed visualization elements like charts and graphs to enhance the interpretability of the data.

**3. Correlation and Regression Analysis:**

In this phase, correlation and regression analyses were performed on Microsoft Excel to uncover relationships among different weather parameters:

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Conducted correlation analysis to identify the degree and direction of relationships between various weather parameters.
 
- **Regression Analysis:**
  - Implemented regression analysis techniques to predict one weather parameter based on others.
  - Employed Python for model creation and assessment, providing valuable insights into the predictive capabilities of the dataset.

**Insights Derived from Advanced Analysis:**

The advanced analysis revealed intricate patterns and correlations within the weather dataset. Key insights include:

- Identification of significant correlations between specific weather parameters, aiding in understanding their interdependence.
- Successful creation of predictive models through regression analysis, enabling the forecasting of weather conditions based on established patterns.
- Visualization of trends and anomalies through interactive dashboards, enhancing the accessibility and communicability of complex weather data.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive record of the meticulous data preparation and advanced analyses performed during Intern Project Phase 1.
